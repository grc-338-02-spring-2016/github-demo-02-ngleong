    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
posted by BGB, November 15, 2012

<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>



    <p>Location: <br>Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA<br></p>
    <p>Hours: <br>Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to midnight</p>
